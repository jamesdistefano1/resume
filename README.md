My resume displayed as a mock website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

One of my newest interests as a developer is using HTML, CSS, and Javascripts to build websites.

It's very basic as of right now, but I will continue to update this repository to show some of the skills I am practicing.  I am going to   focus on learning and implementing different features of CSS and Javascript to add style and effects to web pages.

My next step is to make the CSS file more organized and concise, improve the spacing and margins, and to add more javaScript code to make   the page interactive.
