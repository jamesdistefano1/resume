My resume displayed as a mock website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

One of my newest interests as a developer is using HTML, CSS, and Javascripts to build websites.

It's very basic as of right now, but I will continue to update this repository to show some of the skills I am practicing.  I am going to   focus on learning and implementing different features of CSS and Javascript to add style and effects to web pages.
